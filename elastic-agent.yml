# Logging

# There are four options for the log output: file, stderr, syslog, eventlog
# The file output is the default.

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#agent.logging.level: info

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", "service"
# Multiple selectors can be chained.
#agent.logging.selectors: [ ]

# Send all logging output to stderr. The default is false.
agent.logging.to_stderr: true

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#agent.logging.to_syslog: false

# Send all logging output to Windows Event Logs. The default is false.
#agent.logging.to_eventlog: false

# If enabled, Elastic-Agent periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
# all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. This setting is also passed
# to beats running under the agent. The default is true.
#agent.logging.metrics.enabled: true

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#agent.logging.metrics.period: 30s

# Logging to rotating files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
# files.
#agent.logging.to_files: true
#agent.logging.files:
  # Configure the path where the logs are written. The default is the logs directory
  # under the home path (the binary location).
  #path: /var/log/elastic-agent

  # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
  #name: elastic-agent

  # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
  # automatically rotated
  #rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

  # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
  #keepfiles: 7

  # The permissions mask to apply when rotating log files. The default value is 0600.
  # Must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in octal notation.
  #permissions: 0600

  # Enable log file rotation on time intervals in addition to size-based rotation.
  # Intervals must be at least 1s. Values of 1m, 1h, 24h, 7*24h, 30*24h, and 365*24h
  # are boundary-aligned with minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years as
  # reported by the local system clock. All other intervals are calculated from the
  # Unix epoch. Defaults to disabled.
  #interval: 0

  # Rotate existing logs on startup rather than appending to the existing
  # file. Defaults to true.
  # rotateonstartup: true
